### HW due next Thursday (9/17/15) @ 6pm

* Add a README to your HW repo. Use the following application ([Mou](http://25.io/mou/)) to edit the markdown file. Markdown (.md filetype) is a popular text file format for web-based content. All github README files are based on markdown. Your readme should include the following:
	* A photo of you!
	* A brief bio
* Finish the Branch + Leaf code we started in class. Add your own personal flare.
* ** ADVANCED:** if you cruised through HWs 1 & 2. Try using the techniques that we've been learning to create a procedurally generated flower. Then add that flower to your branch with your leaves as well!
